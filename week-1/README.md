# Challenge: CSV to JSON

In this challenge, you're given a csv file on this folder. You should write a script/program which will take filename as argument and convert it into json and save it into result.json file.

Please read the example and guidelines.

## Example

```bash
python main.py data.csv
```

```json
[
    {
        "first_name" : "test_first_name",
        "last_name" : "test_last_name",
        "age": 10
    },
    {
        "first_name" : "test_first_name_two",
        "last_name" : "test_last_name_two",
        "age": 35
    }
]
```

## Guidelines

- Try not to include any dependencies and solve by using the data structures and standard functions given by the language itself.

- Read the example carefully and make sure the `age` field is converted into number.

- Don't try to edit other's solution or copy other's solution as it's just for you to improve and try interesting challenges yourself and submit your solution by making respective folder or your username.

- Don't forget to save the output to a file. Don't just print the output to standard output.

- You're allowed to use any language and any tools but try to implement it from as scratch as possible.
